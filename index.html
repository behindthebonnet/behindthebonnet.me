(this is an `index.html` file â€” all the code here will go to your main site: **behindthebonnet.me**)

At this point, you should already have **GitHub Education** set up, which gives you access to **Copilot** for Visual Studio Code. Here's a step-by-step to help you make your first website:

---

### 1. **Download Visual Studio Code**

Use this link:
ðŸ‘‰ [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user)
If that doesnâ€™t work, use this one:
ðŸ‘‰ [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Download it, then install it like any normal app.

---

### 2. **Install Extensions**

Once youâ€™ve installed Visual Studio Code and opened it:

* Go to the **Extensions tab** (it looks like 4 little squares on the left sidebar).
* Search and download two extensions:

  * `GitHub Copilot`
  * `HTML Preview`
* Make sure you **press "Accept" and "Trust Publisher"** if it asks.

---

### 3. **Go to the Source Control Tab**

This tab looks like a little circle splitting into 2 (kind of like a Y shape) â€” click it.

Once youâ€™re there, itâ€™s gonna ask you to:

* **Login with GitHub** (go ahead and do that).
* **Install Git** (sometimes it asks you automatically â€” but if not, go to this link and install it yourself):
  ðŸ‘‰ [https://git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)

Once Git is installed and youâ€™re logged in, youâ€™re good to go.

---

### 4. **Clone Your GitHub Repository**

Once youâ€™re logged into your GitHub account inside VS Code:

* Go to the **search bar** (top of VS Code).
* Look for:

  ```
  GitHub: Clone Repository
  ```
* After clicking that, itâ€™s gonna ask you to choose a repo.

Choose the one that looks like:

```
behindthebonnet or behindthebonnet.me
```

Once you choose it, youâ€™ll see all the code from your GitHub show up in VS Code. It just copied ("cloned") your website code to your computer.

---

### 5. **Open the index.html File**

This is the **main file** that controls what your website looks like.

* On the left side (file tree), find and open:

  ```
  index.html
  ```

---

### 6. **Set Up GitHub Copilot**

* At the top right of VS Code, next to the search bar, click the **Copilot icon** (should look like a little robot or smiley face).
* Copilot will open on the side.
* Itâ€™s gonna ask you to **log in with your Microsoft account** â€” go ahead and do that.
* After you're logged in, **put Copilot in Agent Mode**.

Now you should be able to **ask Copilot to add or change stuff** in your website. Itâ€™ll help you write the code.

---

### 7. **Start Building Your Website**

Youâ€™re now ready to build your site! You can:

* Manually edit the `index.html` file
* OR talk to Copilot in the side panel and say stuff like:

  ```
  Add a title that says "Welcome to Behind The Bonnet"
  Make a black background with white text
  Add a button that links to my Instagram
  ```

Copilot will write the code for you right inside the file.

---

### 8. **(Optional) Preview Your Site**

If you installed the **HTML Preview** extension:

* Right-click on `index.html`
* Click something like **"Open with Live Preview"** (depends on the extension you got)

This will let you see what your website looks like without needing to upload it.

---

### 9. **Save and Push Changes to GitHub**

Once youâ€™re done editing and like what you see:

* Go back to the **Source Control tab**
* Type a quick message like or press the little sparkle icon to ai generate a save message:

  ```
  updated homepage
  ```
* Click the arrow button next to the checkmark (âœ“)
* Then click **â€œPush and Commit"**

After a minute or two, your changes will be live on:
ðŸ‘‰ `https://behindthebonnet.me`
